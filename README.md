# ALTO4 to TEI P5
This application prepares a TEI edition of a digitzed document whose pages were transcribed and encoded in ALTO4 files using the HTR tool [eScriptorium](https://traces6.paris.inria.fr/).

It follows [SegmOnto's](https://github.com/SegmOnto/) controlled vocabulary and has been designed as part of the [Gallic(orpor)a](https://github.com/Gallicorpora) pipeline.
